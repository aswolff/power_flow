# Power Flow

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook gets electricity data from api.eia.gov and weather data from Open-Meteo API client
We explore the data and create exogenous variables to identify trends in power consumption
We create different forecaster models to predict future electricity consumption
We compare different models and list their pros/cons
At the bottom, it shows the predicted electricty demand for the next 24 hours

## Features
- Grabs Electricty and Weather Data through multiple API calls
- Visualization of Demand Data to identify trends
- Create multiple prediction models using the skforecast library

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Install required Python libraries (as listed above).
3. Download and open the `power_flow.ipynb` notebook.
4. Execute the cells in sequence to perform the analysis.
